        <h2>Manu’s motivations</h2>
        <p>Indian shooter had a tough time after Tokyo debacle, 
            and took her time to reset her target again, 
            and reaping the rewards.
        </p>
        <p>Manu Bhaker became the first woman shooter from India ever
            to win an Olympics medal, after claiming a bronze medal in 
            the women’s 10m air pistol event at the Paris Olympics on 
            Sunday. She was just 0.1 behind Kim Yeji when she was 
            eliminated in the final on Sunday. Kim eventually won a 
            silver medal while her Korean compatriot Oh Ye Jin claimed
            a gold medal.
