        <h2>Exploring the wonders of the World</h2>
        <p>
            These ancient wonders are Colossus of Rhodes, Great Pyramid of Giza,
            Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Statue of Zeus at Olympia, Temple of Artemis
            at Ephesus, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and Lighthouse of Alexandria.
        </p>
        <p>
            The seven wonders on Antipater's list won praises for their notable features,
            ranging from superlatives of the highest or largest of their types, to the 
            artistry with which they were executed. Their architectural and artistic features
            were imitated throughout the Hellenistic world and beyond.
